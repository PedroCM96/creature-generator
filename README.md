# Sprite Generator
Application for customize character creation based on Pokèmon 4th gen.
## Example of use
![usage GIF](example.gif)
The character traits, what clothes it wears and what body it has,
is determined by a 64-bit seed, but could be easily extended if more bits of customization are needed. 

The application takes this seed and splits it into 8-bit chunks. Currently only the first six chunks are in use, 
corresponding to this character's body type, cap, hair, top, bottom, and bag.

The style of the application is very simple, I have based on the look and feel of the 4th generation Pokémon games.
